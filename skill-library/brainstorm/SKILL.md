# /brainstorm — Design Exploration & Option Generation

## When to use
When the user says "brainstorm", "design", "think through", "options for",
"how should we", or needs to explore approaches before implementing.
Use this instead of any plan mode for non-trivial features.

## Steps

### 1. MEMORY CHECK
- search_knowledge("[topic]") — prior art, known issues, past decisions
- search_knowledge("[topic]", mode="all") — include observations
- If relevant history exists, present it as context before exploring

### 2. EXPLORE
- Read relevant source files, understand existing patterns
- Grep for related implementations, imports, dependencies
- Map the affected area: what files, what APIs, what tests exist
- Identify constraints: framework rules, gate requirements, dependencies

### 3. DESIGN OPTIONS
Generate 2-3 distinct approaches. For each option:
- **Name**: Short descriptive label (e.g., "Gate-based approach")
- **How it works**: 3-5 sentences explaining the mechanism
- **Files affected**: List of files to create/modify
- **Trade-offs**: Pros and cons (be honest, not salesy)
- **Effort**: Small / Medium / Large
- **Risk**: Low / Medium / High

### 4. RECOMMEND
- State which option you recommend and why (1-2 sentences)
- Flag any unknowns or questions that could change the recommendation

### 5. SAVE DESIGN DOC
Write the design doc to docs/plans/<feature-slug>.md with this structure:

  # Design: <Feature Name>
  ## Problem
  ## Context (from memory + exploration)
  ## Options
  ### Option A: ...
  ### Option B: ...
  ### Option C: ...
  ## Recommendation
  ## Open Questions

Also present the options inline in chat for immediate review.

### 6. SAVE TO MEMORY
- remember_this("Design: [feature] — [recommended option summary]",
  "[context]", "type:decision,area:[relevant]")

## Output
- Design doc saved to docs/plans/<feature-slug>.md
- Options presented inline for user review
- User picks an option, then runs /writing-plans to get TDD implementation plan
